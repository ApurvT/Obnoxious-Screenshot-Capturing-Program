Don't miss a moment with the Obnoxious Screenshot Capturing Program(OSCP)! This tool goes beyond just simple screenshots, it allows you to set the frequency and gives you the control over what you store on your system.

The program is written in C# and the GUI was created using Windows Presentation Foundation(WPF). If any of the code looks well written or particularly efficient, it was ~~probably~~ stolen off of Stack Overflow or some other part of the web. Unfortunately, I didn't keep track of where exactly I took it from and I apologize to their respective authors. Everything else was written by yours truly.

The logo was created by skewing a royalty free SVG image I took from IconFinder. Shoutout to the original creator.

*I have not tested this ~~extensively~~ at all and I doubt it will be very efficient. This was truly just a high effort shit post. My aim was to create something humorous and I will not be held responsbile if this program causes your computer to explode and/or causes it to start shooting pink dildos at you. Use at your own risk.*
